# Version 9.3.0 (??? 2019)

## Removed or renamed functions, options and objects

* Refactored `MomentumCombine` and removed duplicating `MomentumCombine2`. (4233f90e)
* Remove a call to `ChangeDimension` from `Explicit`. The `Dimension` option should already handle this, so that we don't need to call another function. (d1dd1def)
* Renamed `MemoryAvailable` and `$MemoryAvailable` to `FCMemoryAvailable` and `$FCMemoryAvailable`. This is necessary, as `MemoryAvailable` is a system variable since Mathematica 11.0. (3c18c338)
* Renamed `PropagatorDenominatorExplicit` to `FeynAmpDenominatorExplicit`. This naming scheme is more consistent, since it fits to other functions that start with `FeynAmpDenominator`. Of course, `PropagatorDenominatorExplicit` will still work in order not to break the existing codes. (8bfefcda)
* Removed the global obsolete typesetting option `$PairBrackets`. Once a scalar product is multiplied by something else, it will automatically have brackets around it, so that `$PairBrackets=True` is actually never needed. (7d3e6eef)
* Removed the now obsolete `Upper`, `Lower`, `Contract1` and `$LorentzIndices`. (76a6ae59)
* Removed `$Covariant` as since FeynCalc 9.3 we have only upper indices. (9a3ba199)
* Eliminated `TemporalIndex[]`. There is really no point to reinvent the wheel and use this peculiar object instead of just `LorentzIndex[0]`. (3be9fee8)
* Renamed `FCLoopBasisIntegralToTopology` into `FCLoopBasisIntegralToPropagators`. (4188cfdf)
* Renamed `SquareAmplitude` to `SquareAmplitude2`. `SquareAmplitude2` is an experimental function that never became sufficiently stable. The name `SquareAmplitude` will be used for a different function. (23667615)
* Modified the syntax of `FCLoopBasisExtract` so that the dimensions are now given via the `SetDimensions` option. This unifies the behavior among the other `FCLoopBasis*` functions. Furthermore, the new `FCTopology` option allows to include loop momenta that not actually present in the input expression. This is useful when working with integral topologies. (8ab84fdd)
* Modified the default behavior of `DiracSimplify` to automatically evaluate Dirac traces. (b74b4c20)
* Updated the handling of the output format type to address the issue #30. In particular, FeynCalc will now change only the output format of the current front end session, not the global Mathematica option as before. This behavior is controlled by the new global option `$FCTraditionalFormOutput`. (9f409e1f)
* Added new options `ExpandScalarProduct` and `EpsEvaluate` to `FCReplaceMomenta`. (28123ca9)
* Removed the option `ChangeDimension` from `TID`. Implicit changes of the dimension are quite dangerous and may lead to unwanted side effects. It is better to avoid that competely. (6fbd3f22)
* Moved the loader of `TARCER` into a separate file. So we can (and should) load `TARCER` via `$LoadAddOns={"TARCER"}`. The old `$LoadTARCER` is now deprecated. (851efb72)
* Removed `DenominatorOrder` from `OneLoop`. (26641c4c)
* Renamed the `PDEHead` option in `PropagatorDenominatorExplicit` to `Head`. Also added a new option `Denominator`  that allows to wrap propagator denominators (after writing out `FAD`s) in the given head. (51fc4da4)
* Removed `TARCER.nb`. Now that we can generate mx files from `TARCER.m`, the notebook is not needed anymore. Moreover, the code there is already outdated compared to `TARCER.m` (6a0ff0e7)
* Removed `FCMonitor` and `FCMonitorStub` as they are not used in TID anymore. (8e4b3ffa)
* Removed `UVPart`. In the current form it is useless and wrong (thanks to M. Beneke for the suggestion). (cebaf7a5)
* Removed `DiracSimplify2`. All settings related to gamma_5 should be handled by setting a suitable scheme. Otherwise, inconsistencies are unavoidable. (80f64f83)
* Removed the old syntax in `DiracSimplify` where matrices are entered using commas (not dots). This is not used anywhere and is not a good way to enter expressions. (d990e683)
* Updated `FeynCalc` installer to 1) Suggest using TraditionalForm to have the typesetting 2) Offer a silent mode for Mathematica Online and similar systems where we do not have the full frontend. (e185ab9e)
* Removed `CrossProduct`, `DotProduct` and `ThreeVector`. Now that we have native support for symbolic Cartesian vectors, they are not needed anymore. (4c7ff29a)
* Introduced `$RenameFeynCalcObjects`. This effectively permits monkey patching of FeynCalc and can be useful to avoid shadowing when loading FeynCalc with other packages. (6ba90e5f)
* Removed `MakeFeynCalcPrivateContext` and `$IndexPrefix`. (c7510662)
* Removed `Chisholm2`. The functionality has been merged into `Chisholm` and can be accessed via the option `Mode->2`. (45496b34)

## New functions and objects

* Added new function `SpinorChainTranspose`. It transposes the closed spinor chains in the expression, thus effectively switching u and v spinors. The Select option can be used for a flexible choice of chains that should be transposed. (7b832a61)
* Added new function `FCChargeConjugateTransposed` (a shortcut is just `FCCCT`). Given an expression in the Dirac space x, it obtains C x^T C^(-1), where C is the charge conjugation matrix. This is handy when dealing with Majorana spinors. (16e51495)
* Added new object `Li4`, which is just a shortcut for `PolyLog[4,x]`. (44cdfef7)
* Extracted N-point to 4-point reduction from OneLoop and moved it to a separate function `NPointTo4Point`. (fd8949d3)
* Added `UnDeclareCommutator` and `UnDeclareAntiCommutator` that can remove the previously set values of commutators and anticommutators. (eccb96ca)
* Added `FCGramMatrix` and `FCGramDeterminant` that compute the Gramian out of the given list of momenta. (d3009020)
* Improved tensor reduction of Cartesian integrals. (d0ab6d53)
* Added `FCReplaceAll` and `FCReplaceRepeated`, two handy functions for applying replacement rules sequentially. This avoid writing long chains of `ex /. rule1 /. rule2 /. rule3` etc. (00a34b65)
* Added new `DataType` `FCVariable` so that symbols marked as `FCVariable` will be pulled out from `Momentum`, `CartesianMomentum` and `TemporalMomentum`. (d0754e8b)
* Added `ThreeDivergence` to differentiate w.r.t Cartesian vectors. (88d0213e)
* Added new auxiliary function `FCProductSplit` for splitting products into lists w.r.t a list of the given variables. (efedef66)
* Added `FCLoopMixedToCartesianAndTemporal`. (448de342)
* Added `FCLoopPropagatorPowersCombine`, `FCLoopPropagatorPowersExpand`, `FCLoopRemoveNegativePropagatorPowers` and `FCLoopNonIntegerPropagatorsFreeQ` to manage the propagator powers of `CFADs`, `SFADs` and `GFADs`. (ff57f617)
* Added new function `FCLoopSamePropagatorHeadsQ` to detect mixed propagators for which we currently cannot provide full support. (bc9a42f2)
* Added new function `FCLoopMixedIntegralQ` to detect mixed Lorentz-Cartesian integrals. (3c6863cc)
* Added new function `FCLoopEikonalPropagatorFreeQ` to detect eikonal propagators. (9f31f2fb)
* Added `CTdec`, a Cartesian version of `Tdec`. This is the first step on the way to implement `CTID`. (d77968e0)
* Added new function `FCPermuteMomentaRules`, a convenience function for generating replacement rules for all possible permutations (renamings) of the given set of momenta. (9ff9423e)
* Added `FCReloadFunctionFromFile`, an auxiliary function that is useful for debugging the existing FeynCalc functions without reloading the kernel. (c51fe7d0)
* Introduced `FCDuplicateFreeQ`, a cheap replacement for the standard `DuplicateFreeQ`, which is unfortunately not available in Mathematica 8 and 9. (b44bd2f7)
* Added new auxiliary function `FCLoopBasisPropagatorsToTopology` to facilitate the extraction of the topologies from the expressions with loop integrals. (9b3cd7e1)
* Added `SquareAmplitude`, a simple function that multiplies amplitudes with their complex conjugates and returns the result without doing any evaluations. (8165ef48)
* Added `ToSFAD`, a function that converts `FAD`s and `PropagatorDenominator`s to `SFAD`s and `StandardPropagatorDenominator`s. (f300d7f6)
* Added `FCLoopBasisIntegralToTopology`, a handy auxiliary function that converts the given loop integral into a list of the corresponding propagators and scalar products. The powers of propagators can be counted if the options `Tally` is set to `True`. (2db802f3)
* Added `FCLoopBasisGetSize`, a tiny convenience function that returns the number of linearly independent propagators for a topology with the given number of loop of external momenta. (33ce898a)
* Added `FCGetNotebookDirectory[]`, a simple convenience function that is like `NotebookDirectory[]`, but works also when the Front End is not available. (600c95ba)
* Introduced `FCSubsetQ`, a cheap replacement for the standard `SubsetQ`, which is unfortunately not available in Mathematica 8 and 9. (5a4eca2c)
* Added `Zeta6`, `Zeta8` and `Zeta10` including the corresponding simplification rules in `SimplifyPolyLog`. (d25f1125)
* Added `FCReplaceMomenta`, a convenience function for replacing 4-momenta and 3-momenta in the given expressions. (3c5c8ae3)
* Added `$FCShowIEta` to control whether the `I Eta` should be explicitly shown in the `TraditionalForm` typesetting or not. If it is clear that all propagators have `+ I Eta`, it is more useful to set `$FCShowIEta=False`. (300bfb08)
* Introduced `FCProgressBar`. It is a small auxiliary function that can be used to show the current progress of processing a list of objects with a given function. (d72b205e)
* Introduced `FermionicChainSimplify` for basic simplifications of fermionic chains. (4d3649a6)
* Introduced initial support for Dirac matrix chains with explicit Dirac indices (via `FermionicChain`). (fd49dd63)
* Added `FCLoopBasisSplit` an auxiliary function for identifying multi-loop integrals that factorize. (9e22d22a)
* Added `FCShowReferenceCard` and a sample reference card for `FeynArts`. (a1d90ef2)
* Added `SpinorChainChiralSplit`, a function that introduces chiral projectors in spinor chains that contain no gamma^5 or chiral projectors. Could be useful for working with chiral theories. (7cc4169f)
* Added `DiracSubstitute5`. It is a small auxiliary function that replaces `GA[5]` with `GA[6]-GA[7]`. This can be useful, e.g. if the spinor chains should be written in a particular way, always involving chiral projectors. (7b234636)
* Added `FCMakeIndex`. It is a small convenience function for generating indices, i.e. `LorentzIndex`, `SUNIndex` etc. from the output of diagram generators such as `FeynArts` and `QGRAF`. (2fad0817)
* Added a new object `Zeta4`. This is just a placeholder for `Zeta[4]` but it is very convenient when using `SimplifyPolyLog`. (966c8004)
* Added new function `DiracSigmaExpand` that handles expansions of `DiracSigmas`, e.g. `DiracSigma[GSD[p]+GSD[q],GSD[r]]`. (2ed72ef9)
* Added a new function `FCCompareResults`. It offers a convenient way to compare intermediate of final results to the known values. (1dab575b)
* Added `FCSchoutenBruteForce`, a function that attempts to automatically simplify the given expression by applying Schouten's identity. (f23523b6)
* Added several new `SMP` objects. (d53496a9)
* Added `PaVeUVPart`. This function returns UV divregent parts of arbitrary Passarino-Veltman functions. (03d50607)
* Introduced `ToDiracGamma67`, which is an inverse of `DiracSubstitute67`. (ce5c3f8f)
* Outsourced `DiracSubstitute67` out of `DiracSimplify`. Now it is a proper function for replacing chirality projectors with their definitions. (9efa4451)
* Added `SirlinSimplify`, a dedicated function for applying Sirlin's relations to Dirac spinor chains. (9f74883b)
* Added `SpinorChainTrick`, an anologon of `DiracTrick` for products of spinor chains. This is an auxiliary function that will be called by higher level functions that deal with the Dirac algebra. (f0ead943)
* Added `FCCheckSyntax`, a helper function that attempts to identify errors in the user input. (6541e10d)
* Added new function `PauliOrder`. It is like `DiracOrder` but for Pauli matrices. (2759035e)
* Added new option `PauliReduce` to `PauliTrick`. It specifies whether a chain of Pauli matrices should be reduced to at most one matrix by rewriting every pair of matrices in terms of commutator and anticommutator. When set to False, PauliTrick will try to use anticommutation relations to simplify Pauli chains. (e2299af2)
* Added `PauliTrick` to have initial support for simplificiation of Pauli matrices. As far as `D-1` dimensional Pauli matrices are concerned one can use `FCSetPauliSigmaScheme` to specify whether the 3D anticommutator relation should be used in D-1 dimensions. (498504f0)
* Added `FCPauliIsolate`. It is like `FCDiracIsolate`, but for Pauli matrices. (20a1af91)
* Added `PauliSigmaExpand` and `PauliSigmaCombine` which are essentially analogons of `DiracGammaExpand` and `DiracSigmaCombine` for Pauli matrices. (a99b9882)
* Added `CartesianToLorentz`, a function that replaces Cartesian Dirac slashes and Cartesian scalar products with corresponding Lorentz tensors and temporal components. (44a6e961)
* Added `LorentzToCartesian`, a function that decomposes selected Lorentz tensors into their Cartesian and temporal components. (1430daf2)
* Introduced `CartesianScalarProduct` to set scalar products of cartesian vectors and `SetTemporalComponent` to set values of the temporal components of 4-vectors. (3b0c4b1b)
* Added new objects for non-relativistic calculations. Initial `FCI`/`FCE` support is available. Also, `Eps` does not have the option Dimension anymore. (a82bb76e)
* Added `FCSetMetricSignature` and `FCGetMetricSignature`. (30c2c217)
* Added `EpsContractFreeQ` that can quickly check if the given expression contains epsilon tensors that can be contracted with each other. (5b02fd19)
* Added `DummyLorentzIndexFreeQ` that can quickly check if the given expression contains dummy Lorentz indices. (f0547fb9)
* Added `ExpandAll2` for fast expansion of very large expressions (like in Dirac traces). (089eb9e6)
* Introduced `FCPatternFreeQ`. It is just a convenience function that makes it easier to check for patterns in the arguments of FeynCalc functions and helps to avoid duplicated code. (212c2cba)
* Added `TypesettingExplicitLorentzIndex` to allow user defined typesetting of explicit Lorentz indices. (8b1102de)
* Introduced `FCRerouteMomenta`, a handy function that can automatically change the routing of the external momenta to make the amplitudes look simpler. It uses the supplied 4-momentum conservation and tries to minimize the number of momenta in propagators, 4-vectors, scalar products, Dirac slashes etc. (bcabba99)
* Added `ToStandardMatrixElement`. This function wraps spinor chains, color strutctures and polarization vectors into head `StandardMatrixElement`. This functionality was previously available only via `OneLoop`. The idea of having standard matrix elements is described in Denner's famous paper in Fortschritte der Physik, Vol. 41, Nummer 4, 1991, Section 5. (d456057a)

## Examples

* Added a tree level MSSM example. (8f6f5a52)
* Added two new 1-loop examples in pure QED: the born-virtual interference terms for muon production and Bhabha scattering. (6131a61e)
* Cleaned up and refactored the available examples. (554adc1b)
* Updated tree level examples for e+e- -> qqbar and e+e- -> mu+ mu-. (8c15b753)
* Added an explicit verification of Furry's theorem for 1->4 photons. (e496837e)
* Simplified the example for Ga->GaGa. (045b7331)
* Added the new `FeynArts` object `GetFlip` to FeynCalc's `CheckContext` whitelist. (bda4f4e3)
* Added a FeynRules model with phi^3 and phi^4 interactions. (a19450d4)
* Corrected the examples for phi^3 and phi^4. (2edb16e8)
* Cleaned up some examples. (d5469d0f)
* Updated some QCD examples. (b8d6bc99)
* Added some new examples for QCD, phi^3 and phi^4. (e3353d58)
* Added an example for the calculation of the UV-part of the ghost-gluon vertex. (0830116d)

* Updated QCD examples. (8efb974a)
* Added a FeynRules model for QCD (with renormalization constants). (b91ec650)
* Refactored and improved all the QED examples. (8a1aa108)
* Added 5 five more sample QCD/EW calculations. (1479ad69)
* Added two new QED examples that utilize the new `PaVeUVPart` function (1-loop self-energy corrections for the electron and for the photon). (a707bcd7)
* Improved existing examples to utilize the new `PaVeUVPart` function. (962e5d08)
* Added an example for calculations with the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian (the model is generated via `FeynRules`). (d217744e)
* Added an example for the Higgs -> 2 g decay via the top loop. (47482f24)

## New options, features and other improvements

* Updated `FeynCalc` to work with `FeynArts` 3.10. (471d4af0)
* Updated `FCPrepareFAAmp` to handle Majorana spinors. (a84199f2)
* Allowed `DiracGamma` and `PauliSigma` to factor out `FCVariable`-type objects. (955fb6f2)
* Improved `FermionSpinSum` to handle amplitudes squared that involve Majorana spinors. The reordering of spinors in the corresponding chains can be turned off via the option `SpinorChainTranspose`. (71b9d256)
* Added some debugging output in `DotSimplify` and `FCTraceExpand`. (9d622473)
* Improved `ToStandardMatrixElement` to avoid issues with `Collect2` never finishing due to bugs in Mathematica's Factor. The option `Factoring` is now given as a list, e.g. `{Factor2, 5000}`. The second value is the maximal `LeafCount`. Coefficients that have a higher LeafCount value will not be factored but left as they are. The option `TimeConstrained` is passed to `Collect2`. Here we set 3 seconds as a safe default. If the user expects more compact results when facotrization is allowed to try harder, he or she should modify the options `Factoring` and `TimeConstrained` accordingly. (15238e61)
* Improved `TID` to avoid issues with `Collect2` never finishing due to bugs in `Mathematica`'s `Factor`. The option `Factoring` is now given as a list, e.g. `{Factor2, 5000}`. The second value is the maximal `LeafCount`. Coefficients that have a higher `LeafCount` value will not be factored but left as they are. The option `TimeConstrained` is passed to `Collect2`. Here we set 3 seconds as a safe default. If the user expects more compact results when factorization is allowed to try harder, he or she should modify the options `Factoring` and `TimeConstrained` accordingly. (21c9c3d0)
* Added new option `TimeConstrained` to `Collect`. When factorization of a coefficient requires more time than the number of second specified by this option, the factorization of this particular coefficient will be skipped. The default value is `Infinity`. (958d5536)
* Modified the option `Factoring` of `Collect2` so that one can specify the maximal `LeafCount`. Terms that are more complicated than that will not be factorized. (f9a12d59)
* Added new option Momentum to `FeynAmpDenominatorCombine`. It makes it possible to combine only those `FADs` that depend on the given set of momenta. (ee4245e4)
* Improved the typesetting rules to avoid unnecessary calls to `FCI` and `MomentumExpand`. (e11aa3ae)
* Improved simplifications of Dirac chains that contain temporal indices. (e3097739)
* Whitelisted `PaVeReduce` to work with NR quantities. (51477c4e)
* Added a missing simplification in `SUNSimplify`. (ef8500a5)
* Improved the detection of scaleless integrals in `FDS`. (f62cc928)
* Added new option `Expand` to `NTerms`. (e8cc7378)
* Improved `FDS` to remove scaleless eikonal propagators. (d5d68b15)
* Imporved `ApartFF` to deal with temporal integrals in a smarter way. (d8e70625)
* Improved `FCLoopBasisExtract` and `FCLoopBasisIntegralToPropagators` to support integrals with temporal components. (467e86cb)
* Further improvements in `TID` to enable the reduction of mixed integrals. (43cd70fa)
* Improved `SimplifyPolyLog` to convert `PolyLog[a,b,c]` to `Nielsen[a,b,c]`. (29135ecc)
* Added new Option `TimeConstrained` to `FCDiracIsolate`. (fcf27e17)
* Added new option `ChangeDimension` to `ToStandardMatrixElement`. (f70658ae)
* Improved `ApartFF` when working with negative propagator powers. (5a2b39ab)
* Initial version of `TID` capable to reduce `CFADs` and `SFADs`. (ab863779)
* Some improvements in `FDS` for `SFADs` and `CFADs`. (bf4dcd4e)
* Added new option `FAD` to `FCLoopIsolate` and `FCLoopExtract`. (57d8f075)
* Improved `FCLoopCanonicalize` and `FCLoopSolutionList` to support Cartesian integrals. (2caa6cfb)
* Improved `ToPaVe` to support `SFADs`. (3395a452)
* Improved the treatment of `CFADs` and `SFADs` in `FDS`. (3d41a694)
* Added an extra call to `FeynAmpDenominatorSimplify` in `FCMultiLoopTID`. This should take care of scaleless integrals that are ignored by `ApartFF`, as they cannot be simplified via partional fractioning. (46c78f0f)
* Further improvements in `FeynAmpDenominatorCombine`. (7a7493c2)
* Further improvements in `FeynAmpDenominatorCombine`. (9bd0eccf)
* Improved `DiracOrder` to better work with `TGAs`. (2d42c7c3)
* Initial support for distinguishing between `FADs`, `CFADs` and `SFADs` in `FDS`. (6e0f5c7c)
* Improved `FeynAmpDenominatorCombine` for `CFADs` and `SFADs`. (95529a5a)
* Added new option `TraceOfOne` to `FermionicChainSimplify`. (c6a08123)
* Small performance improvements in `FDS`. (81df755e)
* Added documentation for `FCRenameDummyIndices`. (025acc33)
* Whitelisted `FermionSpinSum` for NR calculations. (518d4cd4)
* Added new option `Head` to `Tdec`. It is mainly intended for internal use, where `Tdec` constructs decompositions for Cartesian integrals. Wrapping the momenta with a particular head ensures that a fixed value of `SPD[p,p]` will not influence the decomposition of an integral tha depends on `CSPD[p,p]`. (b1e2b5bd)
* Added new option `SelectFree` to `FCReplaceMomenta`. This allows to filter out arbitrary heads (e.g. `GFADs`) from the list of the objects subject to the momenta replacements. (d00dc59f)
* Added `FCTopology`. Although it is just a placeholder for topologies, it is enormously useful in real calculations. (7239fd6f)
* Improved `FCLoopBasisIncompleteQ` and `FCLoopBasisOverdeterminedQ` to work directly with the `FCTopology` heads. (52bf243d)
* With these fixes we finally can do some tensor reduction for `SFADs`. Currently only via `FCMultiLoopTID`. (ea1f0769)
* Added support for `CFADs`, `SFADs` and `GFADs` in `FCRerouteMomenta`. (26814232)
* Added new option `Numerator` to `ApartFF`. When set to False, partial fractioning will be done only on the propagator denominators but not numerators. This is sometimes more useful when dealing with multiloop integrals. (8918b220)
* Improved `FCCompareResults`. (6287947b)
* Improved `FCLoopBasisOverdeterminedQ` to handle `GFADs` in a proper way. (1d5d7271)
* Some improvements in `FDS` when working with `SFADs` and `CFADs`. (427c4434)
* Made `FCSplit` explicitly fail is the second argument is not a list. This should help to avoid a lot of unexpected bugs. (76a8b277)
* When the option Numerator is set to `False`, `FCLoopIsolate` will collect only w.r.t `FADs`. (6b28b108)
* Some refactoring and improved debugging output in `FCLoopIsolate`. (d9f4ed15)
* Improved the performance of `FeynAmpDenominatorSplit`. (92f81fd1)
* FCLoopBasisExtract is now using `FCLoopBasisPropagatorsToTopology`. (1bada3da)
* Added support for `GFADs` in `FCLoopBasisExtract`. (05085495)
* `FCLoopBasisExtract` is now using `FCLoopBasisIntegralToTopology`. (05732bb0)
* Added some more improvements to `FCLoopBasisIntegralToTopology`. (6195d440)
* Added `FCLoopBasisCreateScalarProducts`, an auxiliary function that creates a list of all loop-momentum dependent scalar products from the given lists of loop and external momenta. (8778efb7)
* Added new options `Pair`, `CartesianPair` and `TemporalPair` to `FCLoopBasisIntegralToTopology`. This way one can decide whether the scalar products should be represented as `FADs` or not. (11b153be)
* Added a new option Negative to `FCLoopBasisIntegralToTopology`. When set to `True`, the powers of scalar products are counted negative. (a2e5485d)
* Improved `FCLoopBasisIntegralToTopology` so that now non-loop terms can be also taken into account via the new option `Rest`. (8ce4ac38)
* Modified `FCApart` not to mess with the propagators when `FDS` is set to `False` and to apply `FCE` (when needed) even to expressions that do not require partial fractioning. (37214903)
* Improved `FCLoopBasisIntegralToTopology` to handle powers of propagators and scalar products in a proper way. (20676a4b)
* Made `FCLoopBasisIntegralToTopology` use `ToSFAD` by default. (b28b0d2b)
* Updated the version number in `Paclet.m`. (154268bb)
* Modified the examples part of the test suite to be able to specify the version of Mathematica. (dad22bae)
* Added new option `Log` to `SimplifyPolyLog`. When set to `True`, `Log`s will not be simplified. (8d750492)
* Added new option Trig to `SimplifyPolyLog`. When set to `False`, trigonometric functions (`ArcSihn`, `ArcCosh`, `ArcTanh`) will not be simplified. (7fb37a60)
* Small improvements in `FCLoopBasisOverDeterminedQ` and `FCLoopBasisExtract`. (207b7f76)
* Added a new option `Abort` to `FCLoopBasisFindCompletion`. When we have a user supplied list of propagators and `Abort` is set to `True`, `FCLoopBasisFindCompletion` will immediately stop once it encounters a propagator that cannot be used to complete the basis. This options makes sense only when `Check` is set to `False`. (4cd8c36f)
* Added `Conjugate[ZetaX]= ZetaX`. (13ceb2a9)
* Updated the Eclipse project file. (a170f3c8)
* Added new option `Numerator` to `FCLoopIsolate` and `FCLoopExtract`. This is meant for the cases when we are interested only in propagators but not in the scalar products (e.g. when we are doing a topology identification). (54c14e95)
* Added new option `ExpandScalarProduct` to `FCLoopBasisFindCompletion`. Internally we need to apply `ExpandScalarProduct` to check the basis completion, but sometimes we want to custom propagators to be returned unexpanded. Now this is possible when `ExpandScalarProduct` is set to `False`. (6e1219da)
* Added new option `Check` to `FCLoopBasisFindCompletion`. When `Check` is set to `False`, we can also supply less propagators than needed to complete the basis via `Method`. As long as those propagators fit properly, they will be accepted. (2defcf3f)
* Improved `ApartFF` to support `CFAD` and `SFAD`. Currently `FDS` is not applicable, which leads to somewhat cumbersome results. (06de9161)
* Improved `FCGramDeterminant` and `FCGramMatrix` to work with Cartesian momenta. (ddd968e0)
* Introduced initial support for `StandardPropagatorDenominator` and `SFAD` that allow to write down more generic covariant propagators propagators than currently possible with `FAD`. (b5fd4003)
* Improved the support for `GenericPropagatorDenominator` and introduced (again still very limited) support for `CartesianPropagatorDenominator` and `CFAD` that allow to write down Cartesian propagators. (45d43f83)
* Small improvements in `FUnitTools `to make the creation of new unit tests more convenient. (b621850f)
* Improved typesetting of `FAD`s so that now objects like `FAD[p,Dimension->4]` or `FAD[{p+q,m}, Dimension->D-4]` will have the momenta displayed with the correct bars and hats. This way now one can immediately see the dimension of a `FAD`. (30542a78)

* Small improvement in `FeynAmpDenominatorSimplify` to handle propagator denominators with fractions in a better way. (4763a181)
* Improved performance of `DiracTrace` by checking if there are dummy indices in the input expression before computing the trace. (60eee612)
* Improved `ExpandScalarProduct` to recognize when there are no scalar products that can be expanded. This helps to speed up the function on very large expressions. (358365b3)
* Improved `ChangeDimension` to work with the new `FermionChain` objects. (262aa4b0)
* Objects like `FV[-p,mu]` should be converted to `-FV[p,mu]` by default. (249d8b22)
* Improved `MomentumCombine` to work on more cases. (f2da34ad)
* Do not silently drop `EulerGamma` when simplifying `PolyGamma` functions in `SimplifyPolyLog`. Instead, this behavior can be now controlled using the `EulerGamma` option. The new default behavior is NOT to drop the `EulerGammas`. (dde6afdd)
* Some more rules for `SimplifyPolyLog`. (615022b1)
* Improved `FCFAConvert` to handle `FeynArts` models with `SUND`s in the Feynman rules (thanks to A. Hayreter). (59002150)

* Added more relations to `SimplifyPolyLog`. (4429da9a)
* Changed the ordering of InitialFunction and `FCFactorOut` in `Collect2`. It is better to first factor out the overall coefficient and then apply the `InitialFunction` (e.g. `Expand`). (3dc17555)
* Corrected the wrong Readme for `TARCER`. (83d74170)
* Added some new `SMP` quantities for renormalization. (da890b9f)
* Improved `FCLoopBasis` functions to abort the evaluation when applied to expressions free of the loop momenta. (4163772a)
* Some cleanups in `PairContract`. (b538f4eb)
* Added a new option `Prefactor` to `FCFAConvert`. (8e8d0b96)
* Added a lexicographical sorting of matrices in Dirac traces (4 dimensions only). This should help to avoid spurious terms that vanish by Schouten's identity. The old behavior can be recovered by setting the options `Sort` to `False`. (e4b75860)
* Some performance improvements in `TID` and `FDS` and `ApartFF`. (1a1c13b8)
* Extended `FCLoopIsolate` to pass the option `Full` to `ExpandScalarProduct`. (4d641b95)
* Added new option `Full` to `ExpandScalarProduct`. Together with the momentum options it allows even more fine-grained expansions, e.g. for `ExpandScalarProduct[SP[l+p1+p2+p3,q1+q2+q3+q4],Momentum->l,Full->False]`. This helps to avoid an unnecessary proliferation of terms. (64c6e504)
* Added a new option `ExpandScalarProduct` to `Contract`. When set to `False`, scalar product will not be expanded which should give a speed up on QCD diagrams with 3- and 4-gluon vertices. (50e860b1)

* Added the `FCE` option to `TID`. (1f044c54)
* Improved debugging output in `DiracSimplify` and `DiracTrace`. (47faf5eb)
* Several improvements in `OneLoopSimplify`. Since it uses TID in the background, it is now also fine to use this function with the global option `$KeepLogDivergentScalelessIntegrals`. (a7a28ff2)
* Added two more relations to `SimplifyPolyLog`. (925e489f)
* Moved `StandardMatrixElement` from `OneLoop.m` to `SharedObjects.m` (6cc1d87b)

* Added new rules to `SimplifyPolyLog`. Those are useful when the argument appears as a square root. The relevant simplifications can be turned off via the `Sqrt` option. (0bc92d2a)
* Added new options `Numerator` and `FactoringDenominator` to `Collect2`. Those are meant for cases when `Collect2` is used on fractions, i.e. `Collect2[(....)/(....),...]`. With `Numerator->True` `Collect2` will be applied only to the numerator but not the denominator. `FactoringDenominator` allows to specify a function that will applied to the denominator, e.g. `Factor2`. (1e48d104)
* Changed the behavior of `Collect2` on expressions that contain none of the specified monomials. Now such expressions will be factored (according to the `Factoring` option) in the output. This is a more consistent behavior compared to what we had before. (c9219af6)
* Added a new option `Nielsen` to `SimplifyPolyLog`. When set to `False`, `Nielsen` functions will be converted to `PolyLogs` in the final result. (5bb8131a)

* Added a new option `MaxIterations` to `ApartFF`. (47a532c9)

* Added new option `DiracTrace` to `DiracSimplify`. When set to `False`, `DiracSimplify` will completely ignore all `DiracTrace`s in the expression. (3a439bbe)
* Refactored and improved `DiracSimplify` to be faster and easier to maintain. Simplifications of spinor chains were outsourced to `SirlinSimplify` and `SpinorChainTrick`. `$SpinorChainMinimal` and `ChisholmSpinor` were removed as they are not needed anymore. (153c344d)
* Made `DiracSigma` vanish by symmetry when both arguments are identical. (2702160e)
* Improved the `Mode->2` option of Chisholm to substitute also sigma^{mu nu} ga^5 according to the relation from Sirlin's 1981 paper. (d3030b84)
* Added new option `Subtract` to `FCHideEpsilon` and `FCShowEpsilon`. This allows one to specify what will be abbreviated together with `1/Eps`, i.e. we are not limited to `1/Eps - EulerGamma + Log[4Pi]` anymore. (0c70248a)
* Allowed `DiracTrace` to keep NDR traces unevaluated. (bb826aa8)

* Added an option `Conjugate` to `ComplexConjugate`. Now it is possible to wrap arbitrary variables into `Conjugate` heads, i.e. coupling constants. (cc79324f)
* Disabled automatic expansion of momenta in Dirac spinors. Otherwise it is impossible to apply `MomentumCombine` when needed. (7ba7fcfd)
* Added a new option `Spinor->Join` to `FCDiracIsolate`. This allows us to wrap products of spinor chains into one head, which is useful for a range of special identities. (fbdfcecf)
* Added a new option `FCJoinDOTs` to `DotSimplify`. This allows to inhibit the joining of DOTs when `Expanding` is set to False. The same option is now also available in `FCDiracIsolate`, `DiracTrick`, `Chisholm`, `DiracOrder` and `EpsChisholm`. (34f08996)
* Added a new option `Join` to `DotSimplify.` This allows to inhibit the joining of DOTs when `Expanding` is set to False. The same option is now also available in `FCDiracIsolate` and `DiracTrick`. (c280442e)

* Improved `DiracTrace` to work with new Cartesian objects. (cc8221dc)
* Improved definition of `Eps` with Cartesian indices. (5c43cf49)
* Added a new option `ChangeDimension` to `FCGetDimensions`. When set to true, the dimensions of Cartesian objects will be determined with respect to the Lorentz objects from which they originate. In this case the dimension of `CV[p,i]` will be 4 and not 3. This is mainly required for functions related to the Dirac algebra, which need to check the dimensions in order to be conistent with different gamma_5 schemes. (d231c3ec)
* Improved `ComplexConjugate` to work with new Cartesian objects. (aed41980)
* Fixed a bug in `FCCanonicalizeDummyIndices` that Lorentz indices were always canonicalized, even when this was turned off via the `Head` option. (808ca5b5)

* Improved `EpsEvaluate` to be faster on very large expressions. (3627da9b)
* Improved `FCSplit` to be faster on very large expressions. (5c42c5f6)

This behavior is controlled by the option `FeynAmpDenominatorCombine`. The default value is `False` (to be compatible with the old behavior). Setting this option to `True` activates the factorization. (8a7553f4)
