# Version 10.0.0 (December 2023)


## Removed or renamed functions, options and objects

* Removed the now obsolete options Schouten and Rename in Contract. (602aa979)
* Removed FCSubsetQ and FCDuplicateFreeQ. Now that we require at least Mma 10, one can use the built-in SubsetQ and DuplicateFreeQ instead. (886ddd6f)
* Removed TwoLoopSimplify. The new multiloop capabilities of FeynCalc 10 make it completely unnecessary. (3cdebaee)
* Removed Tr2. Now that SUNSimplify has been properly refactored, there is no need for Tr2 anymore. (551e2bfb)
* Removed overloading of Tr to use TR. One should better avoid meddling with built-in Mma functions. (13be92a1)
* Removed a bunch of obsolete symbols that Rolf used for his research but that are useless for current and new users. (208a4e93)
* Removed the declaration of GA5 as a noncommutative object, since it is always directly evaluated to DiracGamma[5]. (e4470c91)
* Removed the never used SilentTypeSetting and EvaluateFCGV options of FCGV. (3e7c9fa4)
* Removed the F2L shortcut. (f5c17ad5)
* Removed $FCS and Intersection1. (8df8cf5c)
* Removed Smu in favor of FCGV["S_mu"]. (907cdc7e)
* Removed an unused option in FCLoopPakScalelessQ. (7138a6b3)

* Added new option EpsExpand to EpsEvaluate and various functions that call EpsEvaluate. Setting EpsExpand to False allows to prevent rewritings of Levi-Civita tensors contracted with sums of momenta into sums of Levi-Civita tensors. This may help to keep the resulting expressions more compact, especially when contractions of multiple epsilon tensors are involved. (87f9e8d3)
* Added FCHighLight, Variables2 and Coefficients2. The former is a small helper for highlightning specific expression in the notebook interface, while the latter two are similar to the standard Variables and Coefficients, but are somewhat more flexible and convenient to use. (6429dc88)

* Added new routine SpinorChainEvaluate that handles the evaluation of suitable spinor inner products. SpinorChainEvaluate is also an option of DiracSimplify and many other functions that call DiracSimplify. Via DiracSpinorNormalization it is now possible to have a spinor normalization different  than the standard relativistic one. (f9e0b3b0)
* Added GordonSimplify, a routine for applying Gordon identities to suitable spinor chains of vector or axial-vector current type. (fe8f6a19)
* Added a unit test for ApartFF. (2688f08f)
* Added a warning regarding the DropSumOver option for special classes of Daigrams. (18e2378d)
