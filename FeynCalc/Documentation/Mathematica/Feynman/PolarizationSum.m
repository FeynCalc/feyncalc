(*`PolarizationSum[mu, nu, ... ]` represents the sum over a polarization vector and its complex conjugate with two free indices. Depending on its arguments the function returns different polarization sums for massive or massless vector bosons.*)


(* ::Text:: *)
(*- `PolarizationSum[nu, nu, k]` returns $-g^{\mu \nu}+\frac{k^{\mu} k^{\nu}}{k^2}$, i.e. the sum over the 3 physical polarizations of a massive on-shell vector boson with $m = k^2$.*)
(*- `PolarizationSum[mu, nu]` or `PolarizationSum[mu, nu, k, 0]` gives $-g^{\mu \nu }$. This corresponds to the summation over all $4$ polarizations of a massless vector boson, $2$ of which are unphysical if the particle is on-shell.*)
(*- `PolarizationSum[mu, nu, k, n]` yields $-g^{\mu \nu}+\frac{k^{\mu }n^{\nu}+k^{\nu }n^{\mu }}{k \cdot n} - \frac{n^2 k^{\mu}k^{\nu}}{(k \cdot n)^2}$ which is the so-called axial-gauge polarization sum that picks up only the two physical polarizations of a massless vector boson. Here $n$ is an auxiliary vector that must satisfy $n \cdot k \neq 0$. The physical results will not depend on $n$, yet in practice it is often convenient to identify $n$ with one of the 4-vectors already present in the calculation. For example, in a final state with multiple gluons denoted by their momenta $k_i$, the vector $n$ for the $i$-th gluon could be a $k_j$ with $j \neq i$. Notice that when using this polarization sum in a QCD calculation, one doesn't have to consider diagrams with ghosts in the final states.*)

(*If you need to calculate a polarization sum depending on a 4-momentum that is not on-shell, use the option `VirtualBoson`.*)
