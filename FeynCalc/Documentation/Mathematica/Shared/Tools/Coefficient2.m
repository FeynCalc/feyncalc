(* ::Text:: *)
(*`Coefficient2[exp, form1, form2, ...]` is like Coefficient, but it also allows to extracts coefficients  of `form1, form2, ...` sequentially. To specify the power in `formi`, write it as `{var,pow}`.*)
(**)
(*To keep the prefactor whose coefficient you extracted you need to set the option `Prefactor` to `True`.*)
