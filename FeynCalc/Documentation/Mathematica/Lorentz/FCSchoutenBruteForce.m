(* ::Text:: *)
(*`FCSchoutenBruteForce[exp, {}, {}]`  can be used to show that certain terms are zero by repeatedly applying, Schouten's identity in a brute force way.*)


(* ::Text:: *)
(*The algorithm tries to find replacements which follow from the Schouten's identity and make the length of the given expression shorter.*)


(* ::Text:: *)
(*It is not guaranteed to terminate and in general can often get stuck. Still, with some luck it is often possible to show that certain terms vanish by a sequence of transformations that would be otherwise very difficult to find.*)

(* ::Text:: *)
(*One may not recognize it easily, but the following expression is zero by Schouten's identity*)
