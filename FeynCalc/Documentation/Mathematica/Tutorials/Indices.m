(*When you square an expression with dummy indices, you must rename them first. People often do this by hand, e.g. as in*)


ex1=(FV[p,\[Mu]]+FV[q,\[Mu]])FV[r,\[Mu]]FV[r,\[Nu]]


ex1 (ex1/.\[Mu]->\[Rho])
Contract[%]

(*However, since FeynCalc 9 there is a function for that*)


FCRenameDummyIndices[ex1]


ex1 FCRenameDummyIndices[ex1]
Contract[%]


(* ::Text:: *)
(*Notice that `FCRenameDummyIndices` does not canonicalize the indices*)


FV[p,\[Nu]]FV[q,\[Nu]]-FV[p,\[Mu]]FV[q,\[Mu]]
FCRenameDummyIndices[%]


(* ::Text:: *)
(*But since FeynCalc 9.1 there is a function for that too*)


FV[p,\[Nu]]FV[q,\[Nu]]-FV[p,\[Mu]]FV[q,\[Mu]]
FCCanonicalizeDummyIndices[%]

(*Finally, often we also need to uncontract already contracted indices. This is done by `Uncontract`. By default, it handles only contractions with Dirac matrices and Levi-Civita tensors*)
