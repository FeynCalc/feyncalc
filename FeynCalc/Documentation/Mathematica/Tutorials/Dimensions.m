(*You might have wondered why 4-vectors, scalar products and Dirac matrices all have a bar, like*)
(*$\bar{p}^\mu$ or $\bar{p} \cdot \bar{q}$. The bar is there to specify that they are 4-dimensional objects. Objects that live in $D$ dimensions do not have a bar, cf.*)

(* ::Text:: *)
(*This origin of this notation is a [publication](https://inspirehep.net/record/124212) by Breitenlohner and Maison on the treatment of $\gamma^5$ in $D$ dimensions in the t'Hooft-Veltman scheme. The main idea was that we can decompose indexed objects into $4$- and $D-4$-dimensional pieces, e.g. $p^\mu = \bar{p}^\mu + \hat{p}^\mu$. Consequently, in FeynCalc we can also enter $D-4$-dimensional objects*)

(*When we contract Lorentz tensors from different dimensions, the contractions are resolved according to the rules from the paper of Breitenlohner and Maison, e. g.*)
