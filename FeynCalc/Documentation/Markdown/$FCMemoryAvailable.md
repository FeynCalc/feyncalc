## $FCMemoryAvailable

`$FCMemoryAvailable` is  a global variable which is set to an integer `n`, where `n` is the available amount of main memory in MB. The default is `1/4` of `$SystemMemory`. It should be increased if possible. The higher $FCMemoryAvailable can be, the more intermediate steps do not have to be repeated by FeynCalc.
