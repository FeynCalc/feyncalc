## West

`West` is an option for `DiracTrace` and several other functions that deal with traces of Dirac matrices. The option applies only to the computation of $D$-dimensional traces with an odd number of $\gamma ^5$ in the Breitenlohner-Maison-t'Hooft-Veltman (BMHV) scheme. With `West -> True` (default setting), such traces are computed according to formula  (A.5) from Comp. Phys. Comm 77 (1993) 286-298, which is also known as West's formula. For more details, see the documentation of DiracTrace.
