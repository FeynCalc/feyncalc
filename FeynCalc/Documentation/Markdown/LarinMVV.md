## LarinMVV

`LarinMVV` is an option for `DiracTrace` and several other functions that deal with traces of Dirac matrices. The option applies only to the computation of $D$-dimensional traces with a single $\gamma ^5$ in the Larin scheme. With `LarinMVV -> True` (default setting), such traces are computed according to Eq. (10) from 
[arXiv:1506.04517](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04517.pdf) by S. Moch, J. A. M. Vermaseren and A. Vogt.
