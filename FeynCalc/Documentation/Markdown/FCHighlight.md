## FCHighlight

`FCHighlight[exp, {{symbol1, color1}, {symbol2, color2}, ...}]` highlights the given set of symbols in the output using `Style` and the provided colors. This works only in the frontend and alters the input expression in such a way, that it cannot be processed further (because of the introduced `Style` heads).
