## SelectGraphs

`SelectGraphs` is an option for `OneLoopSum` indicating that only a slected set of graphs of the list provided to `OneLoopSum` is to be calculated. Possible settings are: `SelectGraphs -> {i, j, ...}` or `SelectGraphs -> {a, {b, c}, ...}` which indicates the graphs to be taken from the list provided to `OneLoopSum`. In the second setting the list `{b, c}` indicates that all amplitudes from `b` to `c` should be taken.
