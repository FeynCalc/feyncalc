## PaVeAutoReduce

`PaVeAutoReduce` is an option of `PaVe` and other functions that work with `PaVe` functions. When set to `True`, for some special cases `PaVe` functions will be automatically reduced to simpler expressions. Otherwise, PaVe functions will not be further simplified unless explicitly evaluated by `PaVeReduce`.
