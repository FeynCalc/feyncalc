## IsolateSplit

`IsolateSplit` is an option for `Isolate`. Its setting determines the maximum number of characters of `FortranForm[expr]` which are abbreviated by `Isolate`. If the expression is larger than the indicated number, it is split into smaller pieces and onto each subsum `Isolate` is applied.

With the default setting `IsolateSplit -> Infinity` no splitting is done.
