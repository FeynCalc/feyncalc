(*SchoutenAllowNegativeGain*)


(* ::Text:: *)
(*`SchoutenAllowZeroGain` is an option for `FCSchoutenBruteForce` and other functions that attempt to simplify the input expression by applying Schouten's identity. It is similar to `SchoutenAllowZeroGain` with the difference that even transformations that increase the total number of terms might be applied in an attempt to arrive at a shorter expressions at a later stage.*)
