(*DOT[a, b, ...] is the FeynCalc function for non-commutative multiplication. By default it is set to the Mathematica Dot function. This can in principle be disabled by setting DOT=. (or by commenting out "DOT = Dot;" in the file "FCConfig.m"), but then non-commutative products should to be entered like DOT[ GA[mu], m + GS[p], GA[mu] ] etc..*)
