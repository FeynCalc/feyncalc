## FeynCalcToLaTeX

`FeynCalcToLaTeX[exp]` generates LaTeX with line-breaking  for `exp`.

`FeynCalcToLaTeX[expr, 500]` generates LaTeX for `exp` where `500` is the Window width  setting for the Mathematica frontend. Increasing its value will generate less line breaks.

NB: This function appears to be broken in the recent Mathematica versions, most likely it will be rewritten from scratch in a future version of FeynCalc.
