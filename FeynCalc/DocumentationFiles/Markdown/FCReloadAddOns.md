## FCReloadAddOns

`FCReloadAddOns[{addons}]` is an auxiliary function that attempts to reload FeynCalc addons without restarting the kernel.

It is intended to be a helper tool for FeynCalc developers, which allows one to debug/improve add-ons and test the results on the fly. Depending on the complexity of the given add-on, there might also be severe side effects.

The function is not meant to be invoked by the normal users.
