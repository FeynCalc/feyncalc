##  $TypesettingDimD

The string value of `$TypesettingDimD` determines which symbols will be displayed above $D$-dimensional momenta, Dirac matrices, metric tensors and polarization vectors. This concerns only typesetting in the `TraditionalForm` output and doesn't change the physical behavior of those objects.
