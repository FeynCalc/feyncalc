the quantity that multiplies the loop integral measure $d^D q_1 \\ldots d^D
q_n$ and plays an important role e.g. when deriving the Feynman parameter
representation of the given integral. Apart from specifying an explicit value,
the user may also choose from the following predefined conventions: 

- \"Unity\" - 1 for each loop
- \"Textbook\" - $\\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^D}$ for each loop.

Vermaseren and A. Vogt.";

LightPak::usage=
"LightPak is an option for FCLoopPakOrder and other functions for finding
equivalent topologies or integrals using Pak algorithm. When set to True,
instead of using the full Pak algorithm (which can be slow for complicated
integrals) we use only a lightweight version that is not guaranteed to find
all mappings but requires significantly less time.

The light Pak algorithm is described in the [pySecDec
manual](https://secdec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/full_reference.html).
Essentially, it means that in the step 5 of the full [Pak
algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.0868.pdf) we keep only the first matrix
in the vector, so that the next iteration step generates significantly less
matrices than in the full version.";

functions that attempt to simplify the input expression by applying Schouten's
identity. When set to True, the algorithm would apply Schouten's identity to
the given expression even if this does not decrease the total number of terms
in the expression. This is sometimes useful when the algorithm gets stuck and
cannot find further transformation that would make the expression shorter.";

SchoutenAllowNegativeGain::usage=
"SchoutenAllowZeroGain is an option for FCSchoutenBruteForce and other
functions that attempt to simplify the input expression by applying Schouten's

momenta shifts involved)

This information must be put into the very last list of the FCTopology object
describing the corresponding subtopology. The syntax is marker->topoID where
topoID is the ID of the larger topology.

Setting SubtopologyMarker to False means that the information about
subtopologies will not be added when generating subtopologies and will be
ignored by routines related to topology mappings.";

products are set for 4 and D dimensions. By changing this option the user can

In case of the FCLoopBasis* functions this option specifies the dimensions of
the loop and external momenta to be taken into account when extracting the
propagator basis.";

photon as an external state.";

traces of Dirac matrices. The option applies only to the computation of
$D$-dimensional traces with an odd number of $\\gamma ^5$ in the
