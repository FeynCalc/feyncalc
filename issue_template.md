*  <summary>Your Mathematica version</summary>    

  ```Evaluate $Version in your Mathematica session and paste the output here```

*  <summary>Your FeynCalc version</summary>    

  ```Load FeynCalc, evaluate $FeynCalcVersion and paste the output here```

*  <summary>Did you try to reinstall FeynCalc (stable version) using the automatic installer to make sure that you have the latest bugfixes?</summary>    

  ```Yes/No```

*  <summary>Does your Mathematica initialization file contain statements that might influence the behavior of FeynCalc? Sometimes external packages may modify `init.m` in unusual ways, causing troubles for other codes.</summary>    

  ```Check the output of Import[FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Kernel", "init.m"}], "String"]``` 

*  <summary>Please provide a minimal working example that illustrates the problem and works on a fresh kernel. The example should be provided either by writing the code (as `InputForm`!) directly in the issue text  or by attaching a Mathematica notebook. Please do not post code samples as screenshots, PDF files etc.: Those essentially require us to retype everything by hand, which is annoying and also time consuming. Please explain the difference between the current behavior and the expected behavior.</summary>    

  ```Paste your code here```
